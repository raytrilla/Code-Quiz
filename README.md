# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

The aim of this project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

The Code Quiz is built to meet the following criteria:

* To feature a start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* Questions that contain buttons for each answer.
* When answer is clicked, the next question appears.
* subtract time from the clock if inccorect answer is clicked.
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.

Instead of including individual screenshots, I've attached a video example of the application at work:
